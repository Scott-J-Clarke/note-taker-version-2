# note-taker-application

## Description

This application is called "Note Taker." It was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Node.js and a JSON database on the back-end.

"Note Taker" has some basic features:

- on the right-hand side, the user can enter a "note" they want to remember, like "Monday meeting with John at 9am"
- this note can then be "saved" to the left-hand side by clicking on the disk icon in the top-right side
- saved notes on the left-hand side can be clicked on and viewed again on the right-hand side
- a new note can be entered by clicking on the "+" icon in the top right-hand corner
- each saved note can be deleted by clicking on the trash icon next to it

Through making "Note Taker" I:

- gained experience writing API routes and HTML routes
- became more familiar with the "Insomnia" application
- learned how to better modularize code
